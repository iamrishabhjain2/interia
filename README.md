Images are selected according to the color scheme.

### Colour
For the color scheme, gray and green tones were chosen to match the images on the page, as well as the color scheme of the design studio itself.These colors give an idea of modern, high cost and green gives a fresh look.
<br>

### Fonts
Poppins font was chosen for the entire website. It is one of the Geometric sans serif typefaces, that is very popular for building websites. Each letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections.

### Structure
The page is structured in a well recognizable, user friendly and easy to learn way. Upon arriving to the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with the studio's logo on the left side and the navigation links to the right.
